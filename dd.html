		<p>A pre-workout nutritional bar is a type of energy bar designed to be consumed before physical exercise. It is designed to provide the body with the necessary energy and nutrients for optimal performance during the workout.

        These bars may contain ingredients such as caffeine, taurine, beta-alanine, and branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Caffeine is a stimulant that can increase energy and mental focus, which can be beneficial during exercise. Taurine is an amino acid that can help improve endurance and reduce muscle fatigue. Beta-alanine is an amino acid that can help delay the onset of muscle fatigue and improve performance in high-intensity exercises. BCAAs are essential amino acids that can help prevent muscle breakdown and improve recovery after exercise:</p>
